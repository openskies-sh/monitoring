<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>This step examines whether any operational intents remain.  If any foreign (other than uss_qualifier-owned) operational intents remain, then this step's checks will fail.  If any uss_qualifier-owned operational intents remain, the checks for this step do not fail but instead we proceed to the next test case.  If the area is clear, we skip the next test case.</p>

<h3>15.3. Setup test case</h3>
<h4>15.3.1. Ensure clean workspace test step</h4>
<p>Ensure a clean workspace for testing interactions with a DSS by removing any operational intent references from the DSS that may have been left behind from testing efforts.</p>
<h5>15.3.1.1. 🛑 Operational intent references can be queried by ID check</h5>
<p>If an existing operational intent reference cannot directly be queried by its ID, or if for a non-existing one the DSS replies with a status code different than 404,
the DSS implementation is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>

<p>✅ uss1_dss (2025-07-03T13:16:21.620518Z)</p>
<h5>15.3.1.2. 🛑 Operational intent references can be searched for check</h5>
<p>A client with valid credentials should be allowed to search for operational intents in a given area.
Otherwise, the DSS is not in compliance with <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,2</a></strong>.</p>
<p>✅ uss1_dss (2025-07-03T13:16:21.614003Z)</p>
<h5>15.3.1.3. 🛑 Operational intent reference removed check</h5>
<p>If an existing operational intent cannot be deleted when providing the proper ID and OVN, the DSS implementation is in violation of
<strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This step ensures that no operational intent references with the known test IDs exists in the DSS.</p>
<p>∅ <em>This check was not applicable to this test run and is therefore not statused.</em></p>
<h3>15.4. Key validation on creation test case</h3>
<p>This test case will create multiple operational intent references and verify that the <code>key</code> field
of the parameters to create or update an operational intent reference is properly validated.</p>
<p>That is: the DSS should require that the client provides the OVNs for each entity that is in the vicinity,
both geographically and temporally, of the client's operational intent reference.</p>
<h4>15.4.1. Create first OIR test step</h4>
<p>This step creates one operational intent references. As no other operational intent reference is present,
the <code>key</code> field may remain empty.</p>
<h5>15.4.1.1. 🛑 First operational intent reference in area creation query succeeds check</h5>
<p>With no potentially conflicting entity present, the DSS is expected to allow the creation of an operational intent without
the client specifying any OVN in the <code>key</code> field.</p>
<p>If the DSS rejects a well-formed request to create the operational intent reference, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>

<h4>15.4.2. Create second non-overlapping OIR test step</h4>
<p>This step creates a second operational intent references that does not overlap in time with the first, and
should therefore not require any entry in the <code>key</code> field.</p>
<h5>15.4.2.1. 🛑 Second, non-overlapping operational intent reference creation succeeds check</h5>
<p>With a single existing OIR in the area that is not overlapping in time, the DSS is expected to allow the creation of an operational intent without
the client specifying any OVN in the <code>key</code> field.</p>
<p>If the DSS rejects a well-formed request to create the operational intent reference, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>
<p>✅ uss1_dss (2025-07-03T13:16:21.650050Z)</p>
<h4>15.4.3. Attempt OIR creation overlapping with first OIR test step</h4>
<p>This test step will attempt to create an operational intent reference that intersects with the first of the previously created OIR,
and expect the DSS to require its OVN to be provided in the <code>key</code> field.</p>
<p>This step will validate the response body for the <code>HTTP 409</code> error response from the DSS when it contains the optional <code>missing_operational_intents</code> field.</p>
<h5>15.4.3.1. Non de-conflicted request fails</h5>
<p>This test step fragment validates that requests for operational intent reference creation that
don't show that they have been de-conflicted are rejected with the proper error.</p>
<h6>15.4.3.1.1. 🛑 Create operational intent reference with missing OVN fails check</h6>
<p>If the DSS allows the creation of an operational intent reference that is missing the required OVNs for other entities that exist in its geo-temporal vicinity,
it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,2a</a></strong></p>

this field is expected to contain the conflicting OVNs.</p>
<p>If the field exists but does not contain the conflicting OVNs, then the DSS is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This scenario will check for the scope's availability and transparently ignore checks that can't be conducted.</p>
<p>At least one of the following scopes needs to be available for this scenario to at least partially run:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
<li><code>utm.availability_arbitration</code></li>
<li><code>utm.constraint_management</code></li>

<h2>20. [S17] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference Access Control</h2>
<h3>20.1. Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>20.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>20.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least two separate flight intents in this resource, as it will use their extent
to create two operational intents references.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>20.2.2. dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 1 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>20.2.3. second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS is properly enforcing access control rules, and properly limits the actions of a client against
the resources exposed by the DSS.</p>
<p>The participant under test is responsible for providing this second set of credentials along the primary ones used in most other scenarios.</p>
<h5>20.2.3.1. Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, these credentials must be allowed to create, modify and delete operational intents on the DSS,
as well as querying operational intent references.</p>
<h6>20.2.3.1.1. Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>20.2.3.1.2. Separate subscription</h6>
<p>Note that the subscription (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and this scenario will fail if the second set of credentials belong to the same subscription as the main one.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by second_utm_auth in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>20.2.4. id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>20.3. Setup test case</h3>
<p>Makes sure that the DSS is in a clean and expected state before running the test, and that the passed resources work as required.</p>
<p>The setup will create two separate operational intent references: one for each set of the available credentials.</p>
<h4>20.3.1. Ensure clean workspace test step</h4>

<h3>35.3. Setup test case</h3>
<h4>35.3.1. Ensure clean workspace test step</h4>
<p>Ensure a clean workspace for testing interactions with a DSS by removing any operational intent references from the DSS that may have been left behind from testing efforts.</p>
<h5>35.3.1.1. 🛑 Operational intent references can be queried by ID check</h5>
<p>If an existing operational intent reference cannot directly be queried by its ID, or if for a non-existing one the DSS replies with a status code different than 404,
the DSS implementation is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>

<p>✅ uss2_dss (2025-07-03T13:16:33.328454Z)</p>
<h5>35.3.1.2. 🛑 Operational intent references can be searched for check</h5>
<p>A client with valid credentials should be allowed to search for operational intents in a given area.
Otherwise, the DSS is not in compliance with <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,2</a></strong>.</p>
<p>✅ uss2_dss (2025-07-03T13:16:33.321956Z)</p>
<h5>35.3.1.3. 🛑 Operational intent reference removed check</h5>
<p>If an existing operational intent cannot be deleted when providing the proper ID and OVN, the DSS implementation is in violation of
<strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This step ensures that no operational intent references with the known test IDs exists in the DSS.</p>
<p>∅ <em>This check was not applicable to this test run and is therefore not statused.</em></p>
<h3>35.4. Key validation on creation test case</h3>
<p>This test case will create multiple operational intent references and verify that the <code>key</code> field
of the parameters to create or update an operational intent reference is properly validated.</p>
<p>That is: the DSS should require that the client provides the OVNs for each entity that is in the vicinity,
both geographically and temporally, of the client's operational intent reference.</p>
<h4>35.4.1. Create first OIR test step</h4>
<p>This step creates one operational intent references. As no other operational intent reference is present,
the <code>key</code> field may remain empty.</p>
<h5>35.4.1.1. 🛑 First operational intent reference in area creation query succeeds check</h5>
<p>With no potentially conflicting entity present, the DSS is expected to allow the creation of an operational intent without
the client specifying any OVN in the <code>key</code> field.</p>
<p>If the DSS rejects a well-formed request to create the operational intent reference, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>

<h4>35.4.2. Create second non-overlapping OIR test step</h4>
<p>This step creates a second operational intent references that does not overlap in time with the first, and
should therefore not require any entry in the <code>key</code> field.</p>
<h5>35.4.2.1. 🛑 Second, non-overlapping operational intent reference creation succeeds check</h5>
<p>With a single existing OIR in the area that is not overlapping in time, the DSS is expected to allow the creation of an operational intent without
the client specifying any OVN in the <code>key</code> field.</p>
<p>If the DSS rejects a well-formed request to create the operational intent reference, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>

<h4>35.4.3. Attempt OIR creation overlapping with first OIR test step</h4>
<p>This test step will attempt to create an operational intent reference that intersects with the first of the previously created OIR,
and expect the DSS to require its OVN to be provided in the <code>key</code> field.</p>
<p>This step will validate the response body for the <code>HTTP 409</code> error response from the DSS when it contains the optional <code>missing_operational_intents</code> field.</p>
<h5>35.4.3.1. Non de-conflicted request fails</h5>
<p>This test step fragment validates that requests for operational intent reference creation that
don't show that they have been de-conflicted are rejected with the proper error.</p>
<h6>35.4.3.1.1. 🛑 Create operational intent reference with missing OVN fails check</h6>

<h2>40. [S36] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference Access Control</h2>
<h3>40.1. Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>40.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>40.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least two separate flight intents in this resource, as it will use their extent
to create two operational intents references.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>40.2.2. dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 2 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>40.2.3. second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS is properly enforcing access control rules, and properly limits the actions of a client against
the resources exposed by the DSS.</p>
<p>The participant under test is responsible for providing this second set of credentials along the primary ones used in most other scenarios.</p>
<h5>40.2.3.1. Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, these credentials must be allowed to create, modify and delete operational intents on the DSS,
as well as querying operational intent references.</p>
<h6>40.2.3.1.1. Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>40.2.3.1.2. Separate subscription</h6>
<p>Note that the subscription (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and this scenario will fail if the second set of credentials belong to the same subscription as the main one.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by second_utm_auth in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>40.2.4. id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>40.3. Setup test case</h3>

<h2>46. [S41] Solo happy path</h2>
<h3>46.1. Description</h3>
<p>This scenario performs a simple flight planning sequence with a single USS and no interactions with other USSs.  It
verifies that basic planning functionality for the USS works properly.</p>
<p>It assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance,
PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>46.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>46.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>The FlightIntentsResource must provide the following flight intents:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Flight intent ID</th>
    <th>Flight name</th>
    <th>Priority</th>
    <th>Airspace usage state</th>
    <th>UAS state</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>flight1_planned</code></td>
    <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
    <td rowspan="2">Any (but all the same)</td>
    <td>Planned</td>
    <td rowspan="2">Nominal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>flight1_activated</code></td>
    <td>InUse</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, the start times of all activated intents must be during the time
the test scenario is executed (not before). Additionally, their end times must leave sufficient time for the execution
of the test scenario.</p>

<h3>46.3. Prerequisites check test case</h3>

<h4>46.3.1. Verify area is clear test step</h4>
<p>uss_qualifier verifies with the DSS that there are no operational intents remaining in the area.</p>
<h5>46.3.1.1. 🛑 DSS responses check</h5>
<p>If the DSS fails to reply to a query concerning operational intent references in a given area, or fails to allow the deletion of
an operational intent from its own creator, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>

<h5>46.3.1.2. 🛑 Area is clear of op intents check</h5>
<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<h2>47. [S42] Solo happy path</h2>
<h3>47.1. Description</h3>
<p>This scenario performs a simple flight planning sequence with a single USS and no interactions with other USSs.  It
verifies that basic planning functionality for the USS works properly.</p>
<p>It assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance,
PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>47.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>47.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>The FlightIntentsResource must provide the following flight intents:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Flight intent ID</th>
    <th>Flight name</th>
    <th>Priority</th>
    <th>Airspace usage state</th>
    <th>UAS state</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>flight1_planned</code></td>

    <td>Planned</td>
    <td rowspan="2">Nominal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>flight1_activated</code></td>
    <td>InUse</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, the start times of all activated intents must be during the time
the test scenario is executed (not before). Additionally, their end times must leave sufficient time for the execution
of the test scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>47.2.2. tested_uss</h4>

<h5>47.3.1.2. 🛑 Area is clear of op intents check</h5>
<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the
test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the
sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>

<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the
test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the
sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>

<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<h2>55. [S49] Data Validation of GET operational intents by USS</h2>
<h3>55.1. Description</h3>
<p>This test checks that the USS being tested validates the operational intents received as response to its GET request from another USS.
mock_uss plans an operation designed to be relevant to (but not intersect) the operation tested_uss will plan, and provides the data that tested_uss GETs.
tested_uss validates the GET response from mock_uss and accordingly plan its operation.</p>
<p>The primary requirement tested by this scenario is <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0035</a></strong> because a USS cannot verify its operational intent does not conflict when it cannot obtain valid details for that operational intent.</p>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>55.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>55.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource provides the two flight intents which must be relevant to each other, but must not intersect.
This can generally be accomplished when the convex hulls of the 2D footprints of the two flights intersect, but the polygons do not intersect.
There is an overlap in time and altitude of the two flights.</p>
<ul>
<li>flight_1</li>
<li>flight_2</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>55.2.2. mock_uss</h4>
<p>MockUSSResource that will be used for planning flights, controlling data shared for validation testing, and gathering interuss interactions from mock_uss.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by mock_uss in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>55.2.3. tested_uss</h4>
<p>FlightPlannerResource that will be used for the USS being tested for its data validation of operational intent.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 1 in flight_planners in top-level resource pool.</p>

USS about its operational intent to the subscribing USS in no more than MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification (5) seconds,
95 percent of the time.
To verify that notification was indeed sent for this check, waiting up to MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotificationSeconds gets us
95 percent confidence in declaring the USS non-compliant if notification is not received.
To ensure the notifications sent are not missed for a test case, we can pick a threshold that gives
a very high (e.g., 99 percent per test) confidence of non-compliance. We can make conservative assumptions
about the distribution of the delays. If we assume that the notification delays have a normal distribution
with 95 percentile at 5 seconds, then with the standard deviation of 3.04, we get the 99 percentile at 7.07 seconds.
Hence, for test cases that check notification sent for an operational intent, we will wait for notifications till threshold

is measured from time_start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS -
till time_end - Entity details sent to subscribing USS.
To make sure the test driver gives enough time for notifications to be received by mock_uss,
it marks the time to get interactions from mock_uss as - the time test driver initiates the plan.
The sequence of events is -</p>
<ol>
<li>Test driver initiates plan to tested_uss. t0</li>
<li>tested_uss shares the plan with DSS and receives DSS response. t_time_start.</li>
<li>tested_uss responds to test driver with Completed.</li>
<li>Test driver checks for shared operational_intent in DSS and checks its retrievable. t1</li>
<li>Test driver waits for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds.</li>
<li>Test driver retrieves interactions from mock_uss. t1 + MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</li>
<li>Test driver should find the notification in these interactions to declare that USS sent notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know from above that waiting from t_time_start for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds would
give us 99% confidence that we receive the notifications. But, test_driver doesn't have access to t_time_start.
So, it starts waiting from a point of time after the t_time_start that is t1.
This ensures that test driver waits for a long enough duration before getting the interactions. Hence, we get
a high confidence that the test driver correctly verifies if a notification was sent by tested_uss.</p>

<h6>55.4.2.1.1. 🛑 Plan should fail check</h6>
<p>A USS shouldn't go ahead and plan if it doesn't have accurate information.
As per SCD0035 a USS needs to verify a particular conflict status.
If flight intent data shared for a nearby flight shared is invalid, the USS can't successfully perform that verification.
It couldn't have obtained valid information about the other operational intents it's supposed to verify that conflict status against.
Therefore, the USS should fail an attempt to plan. If the plan succeeds, we know they've violated SCD0035 because they failed to verify that particular conflict status.</p>

<p>The test driver instructs tested_uss to plan flight 1. tested_uss should (per SCD0035) check if any conflicts with flight 2
which is of equal priority and came first.

However, this duration is from time start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS, which does not exist for this check.
In this check we use time start when the test driver asked the USS to plan the failed flight.

<h2>56. [S50] Data Validation of GET operational intents by USS</h2>
<h3>56.1. Description</h3>
<p>This test checks that the USS being tested validates the operational intents received as response to its GET request from another USS.
mock_uss plans an operation designed to be relevant to (but not intersect) the operation tested_uss will plan, and provides the data that tested_uss GETs.
tested_uss validates the GET response from mock_uss and accordingly plan its operation.</p>
<p>The primary requirement tested by this scenario is <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0035</a></strong> because a USS cannot verify its operational intent does not conflict when it cannot obtain valid details for that operational intent.</p>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>56.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>56.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource provides the two flight intents which must be relevant to each other, but must not intersect.
This can generally be accomplished when the convex hulls of the 2D footprints of the two flights intersect, but the polygons do not intersect.
There is an overlap in time and altitude of the two flights.</p>

USS about its operational intent to the subscribing USS in no more than MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification (5) seconds,
95 percent of the time.
To verify that notification was indeed sent for this check, waiting up to MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotificationSeconds gets us
95 percent confidence in declaring the USS non-compliant if notification is not received.
To ensure the notifications sent are not missed for a test case, we can pick a threshold that gives
a very high (e.g., 99 percent per test) confidence of non-compliance. We can make conservative assumptions
about the distribution of the delays. If we assume that the notification delays have a normal distribution
with 95 percentile at 5 seconds, then with the standard deviation of 3.04, we get the 99 percentile at 7.07 seconds.
Hence, for test cases that check notification sent for an operational intent, we will wait for notifications till threshold

<p>As per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0085</a></strong>, MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification
is measured from time_start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS -
till time_end - Entity details sent to subscribing USS.
To make sure the test driver gives enough time for notifications to be received by mock_uss,
it marks the time to get interactions from mock_uss as - the time test driver initiates the plan.
The sequence of events is -</p>
<ol>
<li>Test driver initiates plan to tested_uss. t0</li>
<li>tested_uss shares the plan with DSS and receives DSS response. t_time_start.</li>
<li>tested_uss responds to test driver with Completed.</li>
<li>Test driver checks for shared operational_intent in DSS and checks its retrievable. t1</li>
<li>Test driver waits for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds.</li>
<li>Test driver retrieves interactions from mock_uss. t1 + MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</li>
<li>Test driver should find the notification in these interactions to declare that USS sent notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know from above that waiting from t_time_start for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds would
give us 99% confidence that we receive the notifications. But, test_driver doesn't have access to t_time_start.
So, it starts waiting from a point of time after the t_time_start that is t1.
This ensures that test driver waits for a long enough duration before getting the interactions. Hence, we get
a high confidence that the test driver correctly verifies if a notification was sent by tested_uss.</p>

<h6>56.4.2.1.1. 🛑 Plan should fail check</h6>
<p>A USS shouldn't go ahead and plan if it doesn't have accurate information.

It couldn't have obtained valid information about the other operational intents it's supposed to verify that conflict status against.
Therefore, the USS should fail an attempt to plan. If the plan succeeds, we know they've violated SCD0035 because they failed to verify that particular conflict status.</p>

<h2>57. [S51] Awareness of relevant operational intents</h2>
<h3>57.1. Description</h3>
<p>When a USS submits an operational intent to DSS, a subscription is associated with that operational intent in DSS.
This subscription can be either an implicit or explicit subscription that covers the area of the operational intent.
The subscription helps the USS to be notified of new or modified operations in the area, when its operational intent is in
Activated, NonConforming and Contingent states. In this scenario, we will verify that USS under test has a subscription
to cover the operational intent area, and receives relevant notifications from other USSes.</p>
<ul>

<p>To reach a situation where Flight 1 and Flight 2 do not intersect but are relevant to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>their time ranges and altitudes do intersect;</li>
<li>their geometries do not intersect, but their convex hulls do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>

<h2>58. [S52] Awareness of relevant operational intents</h2>
<h3>58.1. Description</h3>
<p>When a USS submits an operational intent to DSS, a subscription is associated with that operational intent in DSS.
This subscription can be either an implicit or explicit subscription that covers the area of the operational intent.
The subscription helps the USS to be notified of new or modified operations in the area, when its operational intent is in
Activated, NonConforming and Contingent states. In this scenario, we will verify that USS under test has a subscription
to cover the operational intent area, and receives relevant notifications from other USSes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0080</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>58.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>58.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource that provides the following flight intents:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Flight intent ID</th>
        <th>Flight name</th>
        <th>State</th><!-- TODO: Update with usage_state and uas_state when new flight planning API is adopted -->
        <th>Must be relevant, but not intersecting</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_1_planned</code></td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
        <td>Accepted</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_1_activated</code></td>
        <td>Activated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_2_planned</code></td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 2</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Accepted</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_2_planned_modified</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>To reach a situation where Flight 1 and Flight 2 do not intersect but are relevant to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>their time ranges and altitudes do intersect;</li>
<li>their geometries do not intersect, but their convex hulls do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>

<li>it does not respond for operational intent details, and</li>
<li>the conflicting operational intent is in the 'Accepted' state,
The tested USS should evaluate the conflicting operational intent as having the lowest bound priority status, i.e. a priority strictly lower than the lowest priority allowed by the local regulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, the tested USS may either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully plan Flight 1 over the conflicting operational intent, or</li>

<h4>65.3.4. Evaluate system version consistency test step</h4>
<h5>65.3.4.1. ⚠️ Software versions are consistent throughout test run check</h5>
<p>If the system version reported by a participant at one point during the test run is different from the system version reported by that participant at a different point during the test run, that participant cannot meet <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.GEN0305</a></strong> because the test environment and production environment system versions cannot be compared because the version in at least one of those environments does not have a consistent value.</p>

<h2>66. [S60] ASTM F3548 UTM aggregate checks</h2>
<h3>66.1. Overview</h3>
<p>In this special scenario, the report of previously executed ASTM F3548 UTM scenario(s) are evaluated for the
performances of the queries made during their execution.</p>
<h3>66.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>66.2.1. flight_planners</h4>
<p>The flight planners subject to evaluation.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by flight_planners in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>66.3. Performance of SCD requests to USS test case</h3>
<h4>66.3.1. Performance of successful operational intent details requests test step</h4>
<p>In this step, all successful requests for operational intent details made to the USSs that are part of the flight
planners provided as resource are used to determine and evaluate the 95th percentile of the requests durations.</p>
<h5>66.3.1.1. ⚠️ Operational intent details requests take no more than [MaxRespondToOIDetailsRequest] second 95% of the time check</h5>
<p>If the 95th percentile of the requests durations is higher than the threshold <code>MaxRespondToOIDetailsRequest</code> (1 second),
this check will fail per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0075</a></strong>.</p>

<h3>66.4. Interoperability test instance is available test case</h3>
<h4>66.4.1. Interoperability test instance is available test step</h4>
<p>This step verifies that interactions with the interoperability test instances happened and where at least partly successful.</p>
<h5>66.4.1.1. ⚠️ Interoperability test instance is available check</h5>
<p>This check ensures that interactions with the interoperability test instance that each USS must provide are possible.</p>
<p>If all interactions fail, or if no test instance can be reached, the USS is failing to meet <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/f52c9a3282aa03207c5036e19db346f51d240742/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.GEN0300</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If no interaction with a test instance was found, this check is skipped.</p>
